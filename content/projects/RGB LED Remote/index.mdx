This app is for controlling the Chinese LED RGB Light Bulb or 24-Key 5M Strip Lights MagicLighting brand. As of v1.0.7, it will also work with the generic (Chinese) 24-Key LED RGB Strip light!

I had tried all the free RGB LED Remote IR apps, and none of them worked for my specific RGB strip, and noticed in the reviews that it didn't work for a lot of other people either. So I ripped the codes from my own IR remote control.
